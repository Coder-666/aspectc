Aspect-oriented C (ACC) is a research project conducted by the [Middleware Systems Research Group](http://www.msrg.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca). ACC enables aspect-oriented software development with the C programming language. ACC consists of a compiler that translates code written in ACC into ANSI-C code. This code can be compiled by any ANSI-C compliant compiler such as GCC.
ACC is a proposed language design and compiler. ACC serves as one viable aspectC language design. For other designs see the Related Projects section in this Web.
ACC ships with a set of Compiler Tools that help to use ACC as part of larger development projects, either to integrate aspects and ACC compiler into larger builds or to organize new software development builds with aspects in mind.
